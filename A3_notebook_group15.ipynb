        "# Introduction\n",
        "Welcome to the third assignment of the Reinforcement Learning course! In this project, you will dive deep into the world of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Your mission is to implement, extend, and innovate upon the QMix algorithm to train a team of intelligent agents for the Pacman Capture the Flag challenge. You will control two blue Pacman agents, guiding them to work together to capture food while outsmarting their red opponents.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment is divided into three distinct parts:\n",
        "1. **Implement the QMix Algorithm**: You will begin by building the core components of the QMix architecture. This involves creating the individual agent networks and the crucial mixing network that enables centralized training. You will then implement the complete training loop and the QMix loss function to bring your agents to life. The goal here is to establish a solid, working implementation.\n",
        "2. **Specialize in an Advanced Technique**: With a functional QMix agent, each student will choose one specific area to focus on for improvement. This allows you to explore a state-of-the-art MARL topic in depth. Your options will include implementing advanced mixing networks (such as QTran or QPLEX), sophisticated exploration strategies (such as count-based exploration), or enhancing individual agents with techniques from the Rainbow paper.\n",
        "3. **Explore and Innovate**: In the final section, you will build upon the insights gained in Part 2. Based on your experiments, you will be able to identify a promising direction for further improvement and implement it. This is an open-ended challenge where you can explore advanced topics such as policy gradient methods (MAPPO), novel exploration techniques, generalization to random maps, or better observation representations for your agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tournaments: Put Your Agents to the Test\n",
        "Throughout the assignment, you will have the opportunity to test your agents' skills in a series of round-robin tournaments against your peers:\n",
        "\n",
        "Three Intermediate Tournaments: These serve as valuable checkpoints to evaluate\n",
        "your models and refine your training strategies. This are the deadlines for submitting your agents:\n",
        "1.\tMonday 30 November before 10 am.\n",
        "2.\tMonday 7 December before 10 am.\n",
        "3.\tFriday 12 December before 1 pm.\n",
        "\n",
        "One Final Tournament: This determines the ultimate winner! The victorious team will earn a permanent place in the RL course Hall of Fame.\n",
        "\n",
        "All tournaments will be held on the bloxCapture.lay map. For detailed information on submission guidelines and deadlines, please refer to the main assignment document. **It is important to note that tournament results will not impact your grade.** However, we appreciate reflecting in the report based on the video footage of the results of the tournaments in your assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this assignment, you will have gained hands-on experience implementing and experimenting with a powerful MARL algorithm, preparing you to tackle complex multi-agent problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Pacman Environment: [PacMan, a capture the flag variant ](https://ai.berkeley.edu/contest.html)\n",
        "\n",
        "The environment you'll be working in is a cooperative, multi-agent variant of the classic Pacman game. It features multiple agents that must coordinate to achieve a shared objective. Each agent receives its own local observations and must act upon them, making this an ideal testbed for cooperative MARL research.\n",
        "The core game logic is adapted from the Berkeley AI contest, and we encourage you to explore the source code to understand its mechanics. To facilitate training, we have wrapped the game in an interface that follows the popular Gym API, making it straightforward to integrate with your deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The game logic was originally developed at UC Berkeley and is not too hard understand if you want to delve a little bit deeper.\n",
        "\n",
        "The provided code includes a display argument for visualizing gameplay. For the best experience, we recommend running the notebook on a local machine to render the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "A separate document contains a detailed breakdown of the environment, including the observation space, action space, and reward function. Please review it carefully before you begin.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assignment submission\n",
        "\n",
        "For the final submission, you will provide a report detailing your work across all three parts of the assignment. This report is a critical component of the project, as it allows you to document your journey and showcase what you have learned.\n",
        "\n",
        "We place a high value on reflection. We want to see more than just final results as we want to understand your thought process. Explain why you made certain design choices, what challenges you encountered, and what your experiments (incl. the ones that failed) taught you about the algorithms you implemented. Your insights are just as important as the outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "To communicate your findings effectively, please use plots and tables to visualize your results. A clear graph of win rates or training rewards often holds more information than a thousand words. While there is no hard page limit, we encourage you to be concise and clear. Focus on creating a well-structured and insightful analysis of your project.\n",
        "\n",
        "We expect you to submit the following things for the final submission:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The report\n",
        "2. The notebook\n",

        "\n",
        "In this section, you will implement the QMix algorithm to control agents in the PacMan environment. QMix is a powerful algorithm in multi-agent reinforcement learning that allows for centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). The key idea behind QMix is to learn a mixing network that combines individual agent Q-values into a global Q-value, which allows agents to make coordinated decisions while still acting independently during execution. The original QMix paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11485) and will come in handy during implementation of the architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "## QMix Theory Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "QMix is a value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm designed for cooperative tasks. It addresses the challenge of decentralized control while maintaining a centralized training framework. The key idea is to learn individual Q-values for each agent and combine them into a global Q-value that represents the team's joint policy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Core Concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tIndividual Q-Values: Each agent has a separate Q-network that predicts the Q-values for its actions based on its local observations.\n",
        "2.\tGlobal Q-Value: A mixer network aggregates the individual Q-values into a global Q-value, ensuring that the global Q-value is monotonic with respect to individual Q-values. This monotonicity ensures that maximizing the global Q-value aligns with maximizing the individual Q-values.\n",
        "3.\tHypernetworks: QMix uses hypernetworks to generate the weights for the mixer network dynamically. These weights depend on the global state, allowing the mixer network to adapt its behavior based on the team's overall situation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "2.\tBuild the mixing network to combine individual Q-values.\n",

        "4.\tTrain the agents in the PacMan environment.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 1.1   Agent Q-Network Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "Before implementing the QMix code, it is essential to have a solid baseline for comparison. You are provided with a working implementation of Independent Q-Learning (IQL). Moreover, you can actually run the notebook and add logging and visualization code (e.g. with WandB) right now, and use the performance of the IQL agent(s) as a reference, since it is guaranteed to reach the maximum score (i.e. the amount of food in the layout) on the tinyCapture layout.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your First Task**: Your first step is to analyze the the provided code and run the IQL agent and analyze its performance. Train it against random opponents on the smaller maps (tinyCapture.lay and smallCapture.lay). Observe its behavior and log its performance (e.g., win rate, score). This analysis will provide a crucial benchmark that will help you evaluate whether your QMix implementation is an improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Evaluate during training**: Track the learning progress of your agents to check whether they are learning or not. A good tool for this is WandB, where you can easily compare different strategies during training."

        "- Analyze and Compare: Rigorously analyze the performance, training time (time per 100k steps for example), training stability, and sample efficiency of your new agent. In your report, compare it directly against the QMix and IQL baseline from Part 1. Does the more expressive network lead to better coordination and higher win rates and average score?\n",
        "### Student 2: Coordinated Exploration with Count-Based Methods\n",
